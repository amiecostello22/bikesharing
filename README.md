# NYC Citi Bike Sharing Data Analysis
### Based on Data from August 2019

## Overview of the Analysis
We viewed the Citi Bike Sharing data from August of 2019 to see if the bike sharing program would be a successful amenity available in Des Moines, Iowa. We took the data to breakdown the trips and checkout times of Citi Bike Sharing Users. We then broke the data down further to get more details on the users based on gender. We created visualizations and a Tableau Story with the data we found.

## Results of the Analysis
### Average Trip Duration by Birth Year
This interactive chart shows the average trip duration based on age. The results showed the trend that the younger the person, the longer trip duration.
### Checkout Time for All Users
This data shows the average trip duration for all users lumped together. The chart is divided by hour and shows most bikes were returned within the first hour.
### User Trip by Weekdays for Each User
This heat map chart shows the most popular bike user time by hour. The most popular times trend toward the late afternoon around 5 pm to 6 pm.
### Checkout Times for Users Based on Gender
This graph is similar to the Checkout Times for All Users, but breaks the data down by gender. Both male and females appeared to have the bikes for similar times, but the data shows that more males checked out the bikes as opposed to females or unknown genders.
### Trips Made Based on Gender
We have male and female comparison heat maps to show the trips made by each gender with the most popular times. As the trends show in the other graph, the popular times are similar on both graphs, but show more male bike riders than female.
### Weekday Trips by User Based on Gender
This data divides itself by gender, but also if the bike was checked out by a single use customer or a Citi Bike Subscriber. Once again, the most popular users are Male Subscribers.
### Gender Breakdown
This simple pie chart breaksdown the amount of male users, female users, or unknown gender users. Per the data shown in the pie chart, there are significantly more male users than females users. This easily explains why the data is skewed to show more popularity for the Citi Bikes with male users.

## Summary
The Citi Bike Sharing program is clearly a popular amenity in New York City. However, there is a large difference between the male and female users of the bikes. This knowledge of the data is necessary when determining if Bike Sharing is a logical choice to bring to Des Moines.
